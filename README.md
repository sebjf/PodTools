# Pod

Tools for working with data of Ubisoft's 1997 racing game "Pod". 

This is a fork from Syroot who deserves all the credit (!!) along with Nico Bendlin http://www.bendlins.de/nico/pod/ for herculean reverse engineering of the original spec!

This fork is intended to facilitate the export of POD assets into 3DS Max and Unity, but using standard interchange formats so it could feasibly transfer to any platform.
